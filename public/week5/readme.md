#### Assignment 6

Expand your app from assginment 5:

- Create a new components that shows all messages across the system according to the mockup
- The user should be able to filter out some lists (using checkboxes) and thereby only see messages on the component for the selected lists
- The new component should list the messages alphabetically
- The user should be able to perform the same actions on each message in the new component (archive, move, delete, _not create_)
- The user should see validation messages in a (provided) notification bar component.

New Validation rules:

- A message cannot bo longer then 200 characters.
- Each message must have unique content across the system.
- If a message doesn't validate upon creation, the notification bar should show an error message.
- If a message _do_ validate, the notification bar should show an success message.
