### Assignment 7

In this assignment you'll have to translate your messages using Googles translate API. This will require you to do asynchronous operations in your very synchronous app. We will provide you with a url to call.

1. Copy your work from assignment 6 to a new folder called `application` in the root of your folder (we will from now on keep working in this folder across assignments)
* Commit that in directly to master (this also means that you will have to merge your changes from ass6 in now)
* Create a language-selector component where you can choose the language to which the messages will be translated and shown in.
* It should be possible to "disable" the translation. The original messages should therefore be kept
* The provided url contains a _key_ that should _not_ be checked in!
* Unrelated: you will have found some ideas for your final project.

We are providing you with a file where you can get the api-key. The file is ignored by git.
