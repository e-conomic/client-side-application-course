# Appointment Application

## Concept

A client application that will enable users to schedule an appointment with a professional. Will utilize the google calendar API to register and serve the appointment information.

[Ugly Mockup here!](https://moqups.com/memphis88/tOK1syYD) (_Appears zoomed on Edge for unknown reasons, better try Chrome_)

A finished product would have 2 target groups:

- the professional(s) hosting the application that will keep track and accept/reject appointments
- the corresponding clients that wish to book an appointment with the professional

This project will initially focus on the view and use cases of the clients.

## User Stories _(Client)_

1. As a client I want to select the week number so that I can review the availability for an appointment on a prefered day.
2. As a client I want to pick a time-frame that is suitable to my schedule to request an appointment from the professional.
3. As a client I want to get notified when my appointment is approved so that I can add it to my schedule.

## Tools

* React
* Redux or plain Flux, not decided yet
* API Client Library for JavaScript (Beta)

## Learning goals

* Familiarization with Google calendar API
* Put in practise all the learning material from the course from previous weeks and improve
* Maybe learn a new Flux flavor (Redux)

### _TODO:_

1. ~~Mockup of the UI layout~~
2. Specify some user stories
