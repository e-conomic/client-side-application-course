# Learn how to build and architect modern client side applications with React at e-conomic

Interested in learning how to build client side (browser) application with React and Redux?  Look no further. This spring e-conomic will host a weekly class, where you can come and learn together with full time developers, that want to learn as well. We will create a space in e-conomic's development department where you have the time to learn, and where you can get help and feedback, in a nice environment in central Copenhagen. At e-conomic we have been pushing code using React to production for more than 2 years and we would love to share our experiences and learnings with you.

## What will we be doing? 
We will watch and follow different series of online courses and talks, and we will complement with our own experiences. The subjects will be a mix of how to use React for making scalable applications and how to make good design and architectural decisions when working with javascript in general.   
It is important that you can work independently and already have some basic programming background. We will try to cover a lot of material and also understand things in depth. So expect to spend at least one full day a week on this course. You will get weekly supervision, code review, and feedback from 2-3 professional developers, that will follow the course with you. To round off the course you will build an application, that could potentially be market ready. We will pitch some ideas for what you can build, but it is up to you. The goal is to build an application that includes a substantial part of the material we have covered.

Check the <a href="#syllabus">syllabus</a> to get a sense of what we will touch during this course.

## Ok, so how much is it?
It's free. We have limited slots open, but the course is free of charge. While e-conomic will supply the location, coffee, and fresh fruit, you must bring your own hard- and software.

## So what is the catch?
There is no catch. We at e-conomic would like to get contact to new and future developers, and show you that e-conomic is a nice place to spend your working hours. We will not dictate what kind of app you can and cannot build. The aim of this course is for you to learn! No strings attached.

## Practicalities

#### When and where

The class will be on:

>**Tuesdays from 12 o'clock starting the 2th of February 2016**   
>@ e-conomic nordic, Langebrogade 1, 1411 KÃ¸benhavn K  

Last course day will be around end-of-April/start-of-May, or at least before end of semesters at the universities..

Direct any questions to our developer Morten at mha@e-conomic.com.

## Prerequisites
*This course will not cover the basics of programming and computer science.*

Before attending this course you must have some programming experience. In particular, you should have touched upon developing client-side applications and be comfortable with javascript.

Furthermore, as you will be working together with other students, you must have some basic knowledge of working with revision control software. At e-conomic we use Git, and we strongly urge you to do so too. While we will gladly help you, there will be no lessons on Git.

Since most of the front-end community is a bit windows terrified, a lot of the tools we'll be using is intended the run on mac.
_That_ being said, it's not a prerequisite for following the course and a good laptop running windows (7+) will do just fine.

## Syllabus 

Please note, this outline is an approximation for the course schedule and subject to adjustments.

 * Week 1: Hello + Practicalities. 
   * why this course?
   * a few words on __JavaScript__
   * what is a __client application__?
   * Superficial React intro
   * Hello world React app
 * Week 2: Dive into __React__
   * Why React? Design considerations behind React, virtual DOM, how it works
   * Motivation behind React
 * Week 3: Dependency management in javascript
   * understanding modules
   * __npm__
   * __webpack__
   * Deploy the application
 * Week 4: One way data flow - __Flux__ part 1
   * What is Flux and why should I care
 * Week 5: One way data flow - __Flux__ part 2
 * Week 6: __(Im)mutable data__
   * How does mutability of data affect us?
   * How can we overcome that? Immutable data!
   * __Immutable.js__
 * Week 7: Application state
   * How is app state kept track of?
   * How can we improve?
   * __Redux__
 * Week 8: Testing client-side applications part 1
   * Common tools for testing in javascript
 * Week 9: Testing client-side applications part 2
 * Week 10 - project
 * Week 11 - project
 * Week 12 - project
 * Week 13 - project

__If__ time permits we will also look into building cross-platform client applications for __iOS__ and __Android__ with __React Native__. 

## Project description (ITU version)

<i>For ITU students. The following is a draft for what a project description could look like in the ITU project base, as an independent ECTS approved project.</i>

<b>Project titel (Dansk):</b> //TODO

<b>Project title (English):</b> Developing Client Side applications with JavaScript and React

<b>Problem statement:</b> Learn how to develop client side web applications written in JavaScript and using React library. These technologies are now widely used in the IT industry, but currently not covered in other courses offered at ITU.

<b>Method:</b> Take weekly lectures led by three full-time developers from e-conomic. The lectures will - as a minimum - cover the material listed in the syllabus of the course. Lectures will be held at e-conomic nordic at their office on Langebrogade in Copenhagen. We will wrap up the course by developing a small client-side web application that, as a minimum, incorporates the theory which has been presented throughout the lectures. Students will present their final projects in teams of 2 or 3.

<b>After the project the student must be able to:</b>

* demonstrate an understanding of the Javascript programming language and reflect upon differences and parallels to previously know programming languages e.g. Java or C#
* explain the characteristics of a client application
* explain the design decision behind React
* demonstrate a solid understanding of the virtual DOM and how it affects HTML processing and rendering performance
* demonstrate a solid understanding of the flux design pattern and how it differs from MVC and MVVM
* explain the differences between immutable and mutable data structures
* design, write and execute unit tests in JavaScript
* write and deploy a client side web application written in JavaScript

To hand in: A client side web application that involves the concepts covered throughout the course. This should include, but is not limited to, creating custom react components, integration with a web service, local persistence. A short technical paper (8-10 pages) discussing the implementation.
